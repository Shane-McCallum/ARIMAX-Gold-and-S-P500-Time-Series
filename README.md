# Gold-Time-Series-comparison
The purpose of this repository is to compare the value of GOLD with the S&P 500.

All data has been collected from yahoo!Finance, Macrotrends, and Kaggle.

In theory, GOLD should increase in value as the S&P decreases in value. In order to 
flesh this out further, I will also include and compare SILVER, Bitcoin, and the gold 
mining company Barrick Gold Corp. 
The questions I want to answer other than the  main hypothesis is: 
1. Does Silver increase as well, being a precious metal like gold?
2. Does Gold have aa dependant correlation with Bitcoin?
3. As gold increases/decreases, does Barrick Gold Corp stock also increase/decrease?
