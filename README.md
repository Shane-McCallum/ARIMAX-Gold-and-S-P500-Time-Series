# Gold-Time-Series-comparison
The purpose of this repository is to compare the value of GOLD with the S&P 500.
All data has been collected from yahoo!Finance, Macrotrends, and Kaggle.
All values are in USD.
In theory, gold (GLD) should increase in value as the S&P 500 index (S&P) decreases in value. In order to 
flesh this out further, I will also include and compare silver (SLV), Bitcoin (BTC), and the gold 
mining company Barrick Gold Corp (GOLD). 
The questions I want to answer other than the  main hypothesis is: 
1. Does Silver increase as well, being a precious metal like gold?
2. Does Gold have any significant correlation with Bitcoin?
3. As gold increases/decreases, does Barrick Gold Corp stock also increase/decrease?
