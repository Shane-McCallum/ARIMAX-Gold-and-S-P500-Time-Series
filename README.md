# ARIMAX Gold and S&P500 Time Series
The purpose of this repository is to compare the value of GOLD with the S&P 500 index.
All data has been collected from yahoo!Finance, Macrotrends, and Kaggle.
All values are in USD.
Hypothesis: The S&P 500 index has a statistically significant, exogenous effect on the value of gold(GLD).
Null Hypothesis: S&P 500 index does not have a statistically significant, exogenous effect on the value of gold.
In order to flesh this out further, I will also include and compare silver (SLV), and the gold 
mining company Barrick Gold Corp (BARR) to see how they relate to the S&P 500 index as well as gold.
